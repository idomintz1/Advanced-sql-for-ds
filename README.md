# Advanced-sql-for-ds
In this exercise, our goal is to prepare the data set of our company sales to predict next week sales.   
The data is stored in our SQL server on https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp.  
We have covered some examples on how to extract the following questions:  
How many orders did we have? How many weeks?  
How many orders for each employee?  
What is the earliest and latest order date for each employee? What is the ratio of orders / weeks for each employee?  
Who was the customer in each employeeâ€™s last order?  
  
**Go back in time and calculate.**     
For each week , the number of orders we had until that point.   
For each week, what is the rolling average orders of the last month?
