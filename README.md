# Advanced-sql-for-ds
In this exercise, our goal is to prepare the data set of our company sales to predict next week sales. 
The data is stored in our SQL server on https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp 
We have covered some examples on how to extract the following questions:
How many orders did we have? How many weeks?
How many orders for each employee?
What is the earliest and latest order date for each employee? What is the ratio of orders / weeks for each employee?
Who was the customer in each employeeâ€™s last order?
Go back in time and calculate
For each week , the number of orders we had until that point
For each week, what is the rolling average orders of the last month?
SQL code is available here
Your task is to continue exploring the data and prepare it for a time-series model by answering the following questions
For each week and employee , what is the rolling average number of orders?
What was the value of order 10248? 
For each week, what is the revenue?
For each week, what is the total revenue earned until that week?
For each week, what is the rolling average revenue of the last month?
For each week and employee, what is the value of last order?
